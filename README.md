This project is based on prototypes. What I wanted here was to create a road with several tunnels, gas stations and speed limits. You can see it on the Console (Dev Tool).
Into the main dashboard, I created 4 dynamic tables. On "Vehicles" table we can see what type of vehicle is on the road, how much money paid on the tunnels, what is the current speed, if the lights are on / off and so
on.
